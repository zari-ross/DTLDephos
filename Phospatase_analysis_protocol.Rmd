# Introduction

This protocol outlines the steps to analyze significantly dephosphorylated residues, predict their likelihood of active dephosphorylation, and infer potential phosphatase involvement using DTL-DephosphoSite models and additional tools.

---

# Step 1: Prepare dataset

1. **Input data**:
   - Start with a list of peptides showing significantly lower phosphorylation in the experimental condition versus control.
   - Extract 31-residue windows around each residue of interest:
     - **15 residues upstream** and **15 residues downstream**.
   - Save the sequences in FASTA format:
     - Example:
       ```
       >Protein_1_Pos_735
       PKKQLILKVISGQQLPKPPDSMFGDSGEIIDPFVEVE
       ```

2. **Split by residue type**:
   - Create two separate FASTA files:
     - One for **S/T residues** (serine/threonine).
     - One for **Y residues** (tyrosine).

---

# Step 2: Run the dtl-dephosphosite models

1. **Input each file**:
   - Run the **S/T model** for the S/T FASTA file.
   - Run the **Y model** for the Y FASTA file.

2. **Record predictions**:
   - Count the number of residues predicted as **dephosphorylated** in each file.

3. **Compare results**:
   - Determine whether more S/T or Y residues were dephosphorylated.
   - Identify proteins with residues showing both S/T and Y dephosphorylation, suggesting dual-specificity phosphatase activity.

---

# Step 3: Extend the analysis

1. **Map results to proteins**:
   - For each predicted dephosphorylated residue, map back to its original protein sequence to identify enriched proteins.

2. **Predict specific phosphatases**:
   - Use external tools to infer which phosphatases might target these residues:
     - **DEPOD** ([http://depod.bioss.uni-freiburg.de/](http://depod.bioss.uni-freiburg.de/)): Provides known phosphatases for specific proteins and residues.
     - **NetPhos 3.1** ([https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetPhos-3.1](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetPhos-3.1)): Predicts phosphorylation sites and potential phosphatases.

# Step 4: Interpret results

1. **Key insights**:
   - Residues predicted as "dephosphorylated" suggest active phosphatase activity.
   - Compare S/T versus Y residue dephosphorylation to infer the activity of S/T-specific or Y-specific phosphatases.

2. **Dual-specificity phosphatases**:
   - Identify potential dual-specificity phosphatases (e.g., PTEN) if the same protein has both S/T and Y dephosphorylation.

3. **Experimental validation**:
   - Select high-confidence predictions for follow-up experimental validation (e.g., phosphatase inhibitors or knockdown assays).

# Conclusion

This protocol combines computational predictions with external tools and experimental insights to effectively identify likely phosphatases and their targets.
